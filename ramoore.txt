I'm a factory supervisor. I am not a turtle. Probably.

git clone *url* // clones a repository(Get url from GitHub, etc.)

git init // turns current directory into git repository, also creates hidden .git folder

git remote add origin "http..."  connects this repository to the url you provide for storage.

git status // shows status of file changes(version control!) and whether those files are included in the upcoming commit

git add *filename*// add changes(new files, edits, etc.) to the upcoming commit.
	'.'  adds all changes

git commit
    -m "comment"  // adds comment to commit and prevents the terminal from opening the git config window thingy.

git push origin master //pushes your changes back to the repository origin that you cloned
